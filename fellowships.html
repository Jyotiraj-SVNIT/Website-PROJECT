<p style="color:yellow;font-size:22px;"><ins>Renewal/Continuation of fellowship:</ins></p>
<p>The Fellow continues to study Basic Science courses in school/junior college/university, and maintains a minimum level of academic performance of first class or 60% (50% for SC/ST/PWD) marks in aggregate or equivalent grade points and the students has to necessarily pass all the subjects prescribed for that particular academic year (two semesters in case of semester system) and should have obtained the above specified percentage of marks.  In the course work, in each academic year, the marks/grades will have to be certified by the Dean or Head of the Institution.   The fellowship will be discontinued if the above marks/grade is not obtained.  However, if the fellow passes all the subjects and obtains greater than 60% ((50% for SC/ST/PWD) marks in the subsequent years, the fellowship can be renewed only from that year onwards, again with the condition that the fellow should obtain 60% (50% for SC/ST/PWD) marks in aggregate every year.  This is effective from 2012 awardees onwards. The Student is eligible to receive the KVPY fellowship upto Pre-PhD level or 5 years whichever is earlier.</p>
<br>
<p>In addition to the above, participation and satisfactory performance in the Summer Camp in the first year and Summer project every year thereafter is required for renewal of the fellowship.</p>
<br>
<p>KVPY Fellows who opt out of the basic science (B.Sc./B.S./B.Stat./B.Math./Int. M.Sc./M.S.) stream at any stage will forfeit the Fellowship and Contingency Grant forthwith.</p>
<br>
<p>The fellowship for the students selected under the stream SA/SX/SB will be started after the XII Standard/ (+2) / I year UG, only if they pursue an undergraduate course in Basic Sciences, that are, B.Sc./B.S./B.Stat./B.Math./Int. M.Sc./M.S. in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Cell Biology, Ecology, Molecular Biology, Botany, Zoology, Physiology, Biotechnology, Neurosciences, Bioinformatics, Marine Biology, Geology, Human Biology, Genetics, Biomedical Sciences, Applied Physics, Materials Science, Environmental Science or Geophysics.</p>
<hr>
<p style="color:white;font-size:18px;">Summer program</p>
<br>
<p>Participation and satisfactory performance in the summer programme/Project each year from the second year (B.Sc./B.S./B.Math./B.Stat /Integrated M.Sc./Integrated M.S.) onwards in an academic Institution of National or International repute or a DSIR approved research labs (in case of private lab or institutions) is mandatory for renewal of the Fellowship. The report on the summer programme /project together with the assessment report from the mentor will have to be forwarded along with the course performance certificate etc. for renewal purpose from second year of B.Sc./B.S./B.Math./B.Stat /Integrated M.Sc./Integrated M.S. program.</p>
<hr>
<p style="color:white;font-size:18px;">Other privileges</p>
<br>
<p>Each KVPY Fellow will be issued an Identity Card so as to have access to National Laboratories/ Universities who have agreed to extend special privileges like library, laboratory facilities, etc. to KVPY Fellows on production of the ID card.</p>
<hr>
<p style="color:white;font-size:18px;">Our Goal</p>
<br>
<p>We hope that the award of the Fellowship to a student acts as an encouragement and motivation to take up research in a subject in B.S. (Basic Sciences) of their liking that induces the student to choose a research career</p>
